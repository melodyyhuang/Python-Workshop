# Python-Workshop
Material for Python Workshops for UCLA Masters of Applied Economics program (Winter 2018, Fall 2018/2019/2020). These should serve as a very gentle introduction to Python. Most of this is written for Python 3. 

More material will be uploaded through time. There is a non-trivial probability that there exist typos; please email me if you find any (m.huang@ucla.edu).
